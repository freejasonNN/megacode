## 🖥️ What is megacode?

megacode is a tool that helps check large .NET software projects for security issues. It scans the code quickly and finds problems that could let attackers do harm. The tool uses a smart system called RLM to understand the code better and give accurate results.

This tool is designed to work with big projects, so it can handle thousands of lines of code without slowing down.

You do not need to be a programmer or have special skills to use megacode. This guide will help you download and start it step by step.
